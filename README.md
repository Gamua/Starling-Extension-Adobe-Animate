Starling Extension: Animate CC "Texture Atlas" Animations
=========================================================

This extension allows to parse and play "Texture Atlas" animations created with *Adobe Animate CC.* 

Different to what the name suggests, the "Texture Atlas" export option of Adobe Animate actually does not create just a texture atlas from an animation (that would be the old "Sprite Sheet" export), but it's an alternative to libraries/tools like "Flump", "Spine", "Dragon Bones", or "GAF".

More information:

* Find usage instructions, as well as a gorgeous sample animation from Chris Georgenes (the guy who created the Starling logo bird) here: [Starling Wiki: Adobe Animate Extension](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/extensions/adobe-animate) 
* An overview about Adobe's "Texture Atlas" export procedure is available on [Adobe Content Corner](https://blogs.adobe.com/contentcorner/2017/07/03/create-a-texture-atlas-with-animate-cc-for-your-favorite-game-engines/)

#### Porting to a different game engine?

If you want to port this extension to a different game engine, feel free to share the included FLA and animation files. Just be sure to keep the respective author's credits intact.
